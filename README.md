# Simple Sentiment Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a basic sentiment analysis model using a decision tree classifier. The goal is to detect the sentiment behind certain phrases and statements. The initial model is trained on a small sample dataset and can be expanded by incorporating a larger dataset for more accurate predictions.

## Features
